# Numerical Integration and Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinear Equations
Numerical methods (computational methods, computational methods) â€”A branch of computational mathematics that studies approximate methods for solving typical mathematical problems that are either not solved or are difficult to solve using exact analytical methods (computational mathematics in the higher sense).

My university scientific research on numerical integration and numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations.

The research describes such methods as:
Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions, Trapezoidal rule
and Simpson's rule for numerical integration as well as Fixed-point iteration, Bisection method, Newton's method for numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations.

All algorithms are described in detail and implemented in the C # language, as well as testing of the algorithms for accuracy.
